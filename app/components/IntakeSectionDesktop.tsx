  This section was labelled with "intake-heading" and given the id of "intake". Quickly
  followed up with an H2 this gives a clean structure for crawlers to work with. I was also
  cognizant to use the keywords of "intake/virtual receptionist" near the top of the section
  to help with indexing. Also, we have the added benefit of having the text come before the
  image which helps crawlers help undestand the reference.
