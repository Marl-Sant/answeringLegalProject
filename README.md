## Why I want to work for Answering Legal
First, I want to thank you for taking the time to review my project. I’ve genuinely enjoyed building this over the past few days.

I want to work for Answering Legal because of my passion for frontend development. While I’m a full-stack engineer, I naturally gravitate toward the frontend because I love seeing my work come to life with every keystroke.

Your company’s long-standing reputation and outstanding reviews reflect an exceptional level of service, one that I’d be proud to contribute to.

Also, if the rest of the team shares the same energy and charm I experienced during my interview, I know I’d be a great cultural fit.

## A Touch of SEO
During my interview, Nick mentioned that SEO would play a significant role in this position. While most of my past projects were internal or not customer-facing, I wanted to take this opportunity to dive deeper into SEO best practices and apply them directly to this assessment.

SEO Improvements I Implemented

Semantic Headings – Used logical heading hierarchy h1 – h3 to help search crawlers understand page structure.

Accessible Image Alts – Added descriptive alt text to improve both accessibility and search visibility.

Structured Metadata – Implemented site-level metadata and JSON-LD schema to improve discoverability across Google and LinkedIn.

I’m confident that this new understanding of SEO will help me bring even more value to your team.
I’m fully expecting to see a wave of “legal answering service” ads following me around for a while… totally worth it.
